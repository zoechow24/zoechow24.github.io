# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: I am currently a graduate student at Northeastern University pursuing my Master of Science in Bioinformatics and a research technician at Weill Cornell Medical School. Iâ€™m hoping to specialize in bioinformatics engineering, as I really enjoy designing and developing programs and also have a passion for medicine and genetics. I would like to one day bridge my interests and develop software tools for biological and/or medical advancements.
